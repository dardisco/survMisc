Fixed comp(), compNSurv() for cases where last element in covMatSurv is NaN
fixed sig() so likelihood-ratio test works for factors (needs call to model.matrix)
fixed cutp() - need to convert data.table to data.frame in function body for now

Fixed autoplot.survfit(): arbitrary alpha now works with upper box in filled survival lines
