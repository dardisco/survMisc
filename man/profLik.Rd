\usage{
  profLik(x, CI = 0.95, interval = 50, mult = c(0.1, 2),
    noPerPage = 2, width = NULL, height = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{A \code{coxph} model}

  \item{CI}{Confidence Interval}

  \item{interval}{Number of points over which to evaluate
  coefficient}

  \item{mult}{Multiplier. Coefficent will be multiplied by
  lower and upper value and evaluated across this range}

  \item{noPerPage}{Number of plots per page}

  \item{width}{Width of screen (display device) in pixels.
  Set to \code{NULL} for default plot size}

  \item{height}{Height of screen (display device) in
  pixels. Set to \code{NULL} for default plot size}
}
\value{
  One plot for each coefficient in the model
}
\description{
  Profile likelihood for coefficients in Coxph model
}
\details{
  Plots of range of values for coefficient in model with
  log-likelihoods for the model with the coefficient fixed
  at these values. \cr \cr For each coefficient a range of
  possible values is chosen, given by
  \eqn{\hat{B}*mult_{lower} -
  \hat{B}*mult_{upper}}{Bhat*mult[lower] -
  Bhat*mult[upper]}. A series of model are fit (given by
  \code{interval}). The coefficient is included in the
  model as a \emph{fixed} term and the partial
  log-likelihood for the model is calculated. \cr \cr A
  curve is plotted which gives the partial log-likelihood
  for each of these candidate values. An appropriate
  confidence interval (CI) is given by subtracting 1/2 the
  value of the approapriate quantile of a chi-squared
  distribution with 1 degree of freedom. \cr \cr Two
  circles are also plotted giving the 95% CI for the Wald
  statistic.
