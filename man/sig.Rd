\usage{
sig(x, ...)

\method{sig}{coxph}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A model of class \code{coxph}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not implemented)}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with one row for each coefficient in the
original model. There are three columns, one for each of the tests:
\item{Wald}{the statistic is:
            \deqn{\frac{\hat{B}}{\hat{SE}}}{
                  B/SE}
            where \eqn{\hat{B}}{B} is the estimate of the coefficient
            and \eqn{\hat{SE}}{SE} is its standard error.}
\item{plr}{\bold{P}artial \bold{l}ikelihood \bold{r}atio test.
           \cr
          The statistic is the difference in the
          likelihood ratio of the original model and that with the coefficient
          omitted.}
\item{lrt}{The \bold{l}og-\bold{r}ank \bold{t}est, aka the \bold{score} test.
             \cr
             The Null hypothesis is that
             \eqn{\hat{B}=0}{B=0}.
             \cr
             The statistic is caculated by refitting the model with the coefficient
             omitted, to generate initial values for the other \eqn{\hat{B}}{B}s.
             \cr
             It is then fitted again with all
             covariates, using these values and setting \eqn{\hat{B}=0}{B=0}.
}
All statistics are distributed as \eqn{\chi}{chi}-square, with degrees of freedom
\eqn{=} number of coefficients \eqn{-1}.
